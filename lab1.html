                    <h1> Quiedah's First Webpage!</h1>
                    <h2> Introduction of Me!</h2>
                    <p>
                    I am a Senior at Metropolitan State University of Denver.
                    Currently, I am a Geography Major with a Minor in GIS.
                    Civil Engineering was my major, until I evaluated my options closely.

                    In addition to being a Student, a wife and a mother of 6, I am working hard to 
                    develop my own corporation in the construction arena.

                    As we all know, the future is always changing and we never know what is the outcome, so enjoy the journey!
